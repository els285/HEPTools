# HEPTools - Spin Tools

Subn-repository for collections of tools used to compute spin parameters and angular observables.

`awkward_spins` is a ROOT-less method for parsing LHE files containing top-quarks and charged leptonic decay products, 
performing the necessary boosts into particular reference frames, and constructing the appropriate angular observables.
